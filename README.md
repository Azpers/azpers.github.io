Notes

Need to add event listener on nav popup so it'll shut on/off automatically

Use 'animation-play-state: paused;' on infinite animations when offscreen or offview.
goign to do something like treeAllButTextSvg[3].style.animationPlayState = 'paused';

I'd like to like push main content to one side and make projects come from the other and the opposite direction for about me section

Gonna go for modals to display get in touch information
