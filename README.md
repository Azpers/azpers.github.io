Notes

Use 'animation-play-state: paused;' on infinite animations when offscreen or offview.
goign to do something like treeAllButTextSvg[3].style.animationPlayState = 'paused';

I'd like to like push main content to one side and make projects come from the other and the opposite direction for about me section

Gonna go for modals to display get in touch information

Gotta decide about leaves con column and if I'll end up using skill icons falling instead or not.

Wanna do like stones will rotate each one til 90deg or flat surface then 2 rods will get off sides and a banner will show. One for each section. idk how I'll do contact info yet
